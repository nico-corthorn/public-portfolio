This is a work-in-progress program.

I am currently finishing the scrapers I need to start the stock market factor model. For these, I used inheritance to made the coding more elegant and parallel computing to capitalize important time savings. I am scraping IEX, Tiingo and the SEC financial statements data sets. I'm paying the $10 monthly fee of Tiingo to be able to download rich price data on one go.

The class ManagerSQL allows to handle information on a PostgreSQL local database.
